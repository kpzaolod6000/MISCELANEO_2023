Footnotes:
1,"Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents."
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services. For more information on the concepts, methods and quality of the data contained in this table, please contact the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics at statcan.ccjcss-ccsjsc.statcan@statcan.gc.ca."
3,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident."
4,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
5,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations."
6,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004."
7,"Starting in 2003, populations for all police services including all rural/provincial detachments have been presented. Prior to 2003, populations for rural detachments are not available."
8,"Youth crime in British Columbia may be somewhat undercounted due to the Crown charge-approval system in place whereby, even for minor offences, there must be approval by the Crown before charges are laid after police have made an arrest. This approval is based on the substantial likelihood of conviction."
9,"In 2011, the introduction of the Immediate Roadside Prohibition (IRP) in British Columbia provided an alternative method for officers to proceed with penalties for impaired drivers and may account for the trends reported for 2011 and 2012."
10,"The increase in incidents of child pornography between 2015 and 2016 in Vancouver can be in part attributed to a proactive project initiated by the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit which recorded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that were in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. As the initiative focused on Vancouver in 2016, notable increases in these offences were reported by this jurisdiction. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution."
11,"Part of the overall increase in police-reported crime in British Columbia and some of its census metropolitan areas in 2019 may be attributed to the implementation of new reporting standards for classifying incidents. More specifically, in January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes. While the effective date for the change was January 2018 and many police services adopted the new standards that year, some police services, including all of the RCMP detachments across Canada and the municipal police services in British Columbia, transitioned to the new standards on January 1, 2019. Additionally, police services in British Columbia undertook a uniform training strategy to further standardize reporting throughout the province. The new reporting standards were expected to result in an increase in crime rates over time."
12,"In Kelowna in 2019, a national RCMP Sexual Assault Review Team undertook a review of current and historical sexual assault cases in the RCMP detachment in Kelowna to ensure appropriate use of the reporting standards for classifying incidents as founded or unfounded. As a result, Kelowna’s 2018 statistics for sexual assault have been revised from the original counts released in July 2019. As well, the file review and adoption of the new incident clearance codes have likely contributed to a notably higher number of sexual assault incidents when compared to previous years."
13,"Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities."
14,"This represents the year-over-year (current year over last year) percentage change in the rate of actual incidents."
15,"Data for unfounded incidents are available for 2017 and subsequent years in order to resume collection that had been halted in 2006 due to inconsistent reporting. To improve comparability, the definition of founded and unfounded criminal incidents was revised in 2017 and any prescribed changes relating to the classification of incidents will be phased in over time starting with the reporting of 2019 data. As such, it is understood that inconsistencies in reporting may still exist in 2017 and 2018. Data may therefore be incomparable across police services."
16,"Total persons charged is the total of adults charged and youth charged."
17,"Data on youth charged and youth not charged may include a small number of people under the age of 12."
18,"Data for youth charged and youth not charged for impaired driving are not available prior to 2007. As a result, comparisons of Total all violations and Total Criminal Code violations (including traffic) over time should be made with caution."
